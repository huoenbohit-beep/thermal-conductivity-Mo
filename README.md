# README: Thermal Conductivity Calculation Workflow for Irradiated Mo  

The file `Mo-eam-cdpa0.0691.data` contains the defect structure at an irradiation dose of 0.0691 cdpa, generated by the CRA method. The LAMMPS input script `CRA.in` performs defect insertion and relaxation following the CRA algorithm, producing the defect structures used in subsequent simulations. The script `pe.in` then thermally equilibrates these defect structures at specified temperatures, producing output files such as `Mo_600K_cdpa0.0691.lammpstrj`.  

Due to the large parameter space (13 temperatures from 300K to 2800K and 15 cdpa doses), extracting all potential energy files manually would be impractical. Thus, we use the script `extract_all_pe.sh` to batch-extract potential energy files (e.g., `Mo-600K-cdpa0.0691.pe.dat`). The program `thermalConductivity.f90` then calculates thermal scattering rates, thermal conductivity, and other properties. Owing to the high computational load, all tasks are automated via batch scripts. This workflow constitutes the core data generation process for the study. Contact us if additional materials are required.  

## Core Files  
- `CRA.in` → LAMMPS input for CRA algorithm (defect insertion + relaxation)  
- `Mo-eam-cdpaX.data` → CRA-generated defect structure (dose=X cdpa)  
- `pe.in` → LAMMPS thermalization script  
- `extract_all_pe.sh` → Batch extraction of potential energy data  
- `thermalConductivity.f90` → Computes thermal scattering rates  

## Workflow  
1. Generate defect structures using CRA (`CRA.in`) → Output `Mo-eam-cdpaX.data`  
2. Thermalize structures with `pe.in` → Output `Mo_TK_cdpaX.lammpstrj`  
3. Run `./extract_all_pe.sh` → Generate `Mo-TK-cdpaX.pe.dat`  
4. Calculate properties using `thermalConductivity.f90`
